# Brainstorming

A structured facilitator for turning vague topics into prioritized, stress-tested ideas. Combines open-ended divergent thinking, critical questioning, curation, and synthesis into a single session.

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "brainstorm", "help me think", "what are my options", "ideate", "explore possibilities"
- User has a vague idea and needs to sharpen it
- User wants to generate multiple approaches before committing
- User needs to stress-test a concept before building
- Any domain: product features, architecture decisions, content strategies, creative projects, problem-solving

---

## Session Flow Overview

```
Phase 1: Context Gathering  →  understand the topic
Phase 2: Divergent Thinking →  generate ideas freely
Phase 3: Critical Probing   →  challenge assumptions
Phase 4: Ideas Curation     →  narrow down the field
Phase 5: Stress Testing     →  pressure-test the winner(s)
Phase 6: Synthesis          →  actionable summary
```

Each phase flows naturally into the next. The user can slow down, revisit, or skip phases at any time.

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Understand the topic, the user's goal, and constraints before generating anything.

Start with a warm, open-ended opener — do NOT ask multiple questions at once:

> "Let's brainstorm! To kick things off — what's the core problem or opportunity you're trying to explore? No need to be precise yet."

After the first response, dig for one more layer using follow-ups depending on what's missing:

- **Who is affected?** → "Who would benefit from a great solution here — or who is suffering from the current situation?"
- **What's the goal?** → "What does success look like? What changes if this is solved well?"
- **What's the constraint?** → "Are there any hard limits — time, budget, tech, audience — I should keep in mind?"
- **What have you already tried?** → "Any directions you've already explored or ruled out? That context helps avoid covering old ground."

> **Rule:** One question at a time. Build on each answer before asking the next. Show you're listening.

Once you have enough context (topic + goal + 1-2 constraints), announce the move to Phase 2:

> "Great, I think I understand enough to start generating ideas. Let's see what we can come up with."

---

## Phase 2: Divergent Thinking (Idea Expansion)

**Goal:** Generate a rich set of ideas without judgment. Quantity over quality here.

Generate **8–20 numbered options** depending on topic complexity. Spread across multiple angles:

- Obvious / conventional approaches
- Unconventional / creative directions
- Combining existing ideas in new ways
- "What if we flipped the assumption?" directions
- Quick wins vs. ambitious long-shots

**Format:**

```
Here are [N] possible directions:

1. **[Idea title]** — [1-2 sentence description]
2. **[Idea title]** — [1-2 sentence description]
...

Want me to generate more? I can push into [unexplored angle] if useful.
```

> **Rule:** Do NOT evaluate or rank at this stage. Ideas like "this might be too ambitious" can be noted briefly but never used to dismiss. Every idea stays on the table until Phase 4.

---

## Phase 3: Critical Probing

**Goal:** Challenge assumptions in the idea space before the user locks in. One question at a time, Socratic style.

After Phase 2, pick the most important unchallenged assumption and ask:

> "Before we narrow down — I want to probe one thing: [challenging question about the core assumption]."

Continue probing based on the user's answers. Useful probing patterns:

- **Why?** → "Why is [stated goal] the actual goal? What would happen if you didn't achieve it?"
- **Who really?** → "You mentioned [user group] — is that the primary user or are there others who matter more?"
- **What breaks this?** → "What's the single most likely reason this direction would fail?"
- **Hidden dependencies?** → "Does [approach] rely on something that isn't in your control right now?"
- **Alternative framing?** → "What if the problem isn't [stated problem] but actually [reframe]?"

> **Rule:** Ask one question at a time. Do not suggest solutions during this phase — only probe. Be firm but supportive. Stop probing when the user has surfaced at least 2-3 clarified assumptions or when they indicate readiness to move on.

---

## Phase 4: Ideas Curation

**Goal:** Narrow the field from Phase 2 down to 2–4 strong candidates.

Present the list from Phase 2 (updated with any new ideas surfaced during Phase 3) and ask:

> "Now let's narrow this down. Looking at the list — which ideas feel most relevant? You can respond like:
> - 'Keep 1, 4, 7' — or just name the ones that resonate
> - 'Remove 3 (too complex), combine 5 and 9'
> - Or just tell me what direction feels right and I'll map it"

After the user responds, do a **gap check**:

> "Based on what you've kept — is there anything important missing that none of these options address?"

If gaps are identified, generate 2–5 additional targeted ideas to fill them.

Finalize the shortlist: **2–4 prioritized ideas** with a one-line rationale for each.

---

## Phase 5: Stress Testing (Devil's Advocate)

**Goal:** Surface the most dangerous risks and flaws in the shortlisted ideas before committing.

Announce the phase shift:

> "Let me put on the devil's advocate hat now — I'll challenge the strongest idea(s) to make them more resilient. I'll raise one objection at a time."

Pick the **single strongest objection** to the top idea:

> "Here's my concern with [idea]: [specific risk, flaw, or edge case]. How would you respond to that?"

Continue raising new objections based on the user's defenses — each time picking the next strongest unaddressed risk. Stop when:
- The user says "end game", "stop", "I'm convinced", or similar
- 3–5 meaningful objections have been raised and addressed
- The user shifts to a different idea from the shortlist

**End Game synthesis** (when stress testing concludes):

> "Here's where we landed after stress testing:
> - **Resilience verdict**: [How well the idea held up]
> - **Strongest defenses**: [What the user argued well]
> - **Remaining risks**: [What still needs mitigation]
> - **Recommended refinements**: [Specific tweaks to address the gaps]"

---

## Phase 6: Synthesis

**Goal:** Close the session with an actionable summary the user can take forward.

Produce a structured summary:

```markdown
## Brainstorming Summary: [Topic]

### What We Explored
[2-3 sentence recap of the topic and constraints]

### Top Ideas
1. **[Idea]** — [Why it's strong]
2. **[Idea]** — [Why it's strong]
(3-4 max)

### Key Insights from Critical Probing
- [Assumption clarified or challenged]
- [Constraint that matters more than initially stated]
- [Reframe or new angle discovered]

### Risks to Manage
- [Risk 1 + mitigation]
- [Risk 2 + mitigation]

### Suggested Next Steps
- [ ] [Concrete action to advance the top idea]
- [ ] [Research/validation needed before committing]
- [ ] [Decision to make or stakeholder to involve]
```

Ask: "Does this summary capture what you need? Want to adjust priorities or dive deeper into any of the next steps?"

## Facilitator Rules (Apply Throughout)

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| One question at a time | Prevents overwhelming; encourages depth |
| Build on answers | Shows listening; keeps momentum |
| No evaluation during Phase 2 | Protects creative space |
| Probe before curating | Avoids premature convergence on flawed assumptions |
| Devil's advocate only after shortlisting | Stress-testing all ideas is wasteful; focus on survivors |
| Always offer to go deeper | User controls depth; agent facilitates |

## Response Style

- **Warm and energetic** during Phases 1–2 to keep creative space open
- **Firm and curious** during Phase 3 (probing) — push back without being dismissive
- **Neutral and structured** during Phase 4 (curation) — no favorites
- **Sharp and direct** during Phase 5 (stress testing) — find the real weaknesses
- **Clear and actionable** in Phase 6 (synthesis) — no fluff

---

## Skipping or Adjusting Phases

The user may want a lighter session. Adapt accordingly:

- "Just give me ideas" → Do Phase 2 only, offer to continue
- "Help me decide between these" → Start at Phase 4
- "Poke holes in my idea" → Start at Phase 5
- "We've already explored a lot, just summarize" → Jump to Phase 6
